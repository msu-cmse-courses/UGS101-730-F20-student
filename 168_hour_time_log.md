This assignment's activity is based on a book by Laura Vanderkam "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/159184410X/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_FZQoFbJTE4HBS">168 hours: You have more time than you think</a>".  In this assignment I would like you to log what you are doing every 6 minutes for an entire week. We choose 6 minutes because that is 1/10 of an hour and should make it easier to keep track. For example if you sleep 7 hours and 30 mintues that is 7.5 hours in your log.  

Please Make a copy of the following google spreadsheet and use it to track your time:

I like to use Google spredseets because it is easy to download the app and updateyour log when you are on your phone, or when you are on the computer.  The following video gives you a basic overview about how to use the template:

## Categories

As a class we will need to decide what categories are useful and what are not.  We need to pick as few categories as possible while having enough to make sense of our data.  Lets start with the following categories:

    Sleep
    Work
    Family
    Housework
    Hobbies
    Transit
    Study
    Grooming
    Eating
    Errands
    Leasure
    Class
    
As a class we may decide to add or remove catigories.  Make sure you use the notes feild to keep track of your information and feel free to add more columns with different categories for your own personal use.  

When you are done, please download your spreadsheet as a CSV file and submit it to the [Desire2Learn](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/home/1172254) course website.
