# Welcome to  Learning in the Digital Age: Academic, Personal, and Professional Considerations!

## Motivation 
At one point in time, distance learning in higher education included sets of cassette tapes with recorded lectures, assignments submitted and returned through the postal service, and exams proctored by a local librarian. Learning outside of the physical classroom takes shape very differently in the age of the internet and amidst new sets of challenges, a pandemic included. The transition from a physical classroom to learning in an online environment is not just a matter of sitting in front of a computer instead of sitting at a desk in a classroom. This course will address the complex academic, personal, and professional components of learning in online environments. In addition, this course will equip students with resources and strategies that support their academic success in online learning. This section is designed for and restricted to students with a major or minor in Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE)

## Format
This single credit seminar course is taught as a live online course with asynchronous options available based on student need.   Students are given short weekly assignments (ex. videos, reading and workshops) designed to help them  learn effectively online and build relationships with their fellow students.   In class students will work individually and in groups in activities designed to engage students and let them take control of their own education.
